    ```

### To start using

1. Start the application by running:

    ```sh
    node index.js
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to interact with the application. You will be presented with a list of options:

    - **View all departments:** Display all departments.
    - **View all roles:** Display all roles.
    - **View all employees:** Display all employees.
    - **View employees by manager:** Display employees grouped by their manager.

    - **Delete a role:** Delete a role.

Each viewing choice will either display the selected data or ask for further specifications to narrow the view. Adding options will prompt you for the necessary information and associated items. Updating choices will present you with a list of items to change and prompt you to make the appropriate changes. The delete options will allow you to remove departments, employees, and roles by selecting the related choice. When you are done, simply select 'Quit'.
